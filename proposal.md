# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Pokemon Matchup Generator

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

An application that would utilize the Pokemon csv from earlier in the semester that would allow the user to select the pokemon, and my application would show the user a list of about 5 pokemon that could be used to counter it. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The user would type the name of a pokemon into a text box. My application would then utilize the csv/database of pokemon at our desposal to find the selected pokemon. It would look at its type and then go into the list of pokemon of a type that has advantage over it. it wil then select the 5 pokemon of that type with the highest average stats. The application would then diosplay a list ( image, name, and posibly stats) of the pokemon that could be used as counters to the issue the user is having. As far as features I am thinking that I may try to integrate sql, as I am learning it in a different class and I think it may be helpful. This is my basic pitch, if you have any comments or ideas I would love to hear them, as I am open to improving on this concept.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

I am not planning on combining this project with other courses, buit I will be utilizing skills that I am learning in MIS3502 (sql, java, and html coding).

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

I will not be collaborating on this project

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

No matter what the user will be able to input a pokemon name and recieve a list of suitable counters. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome would be able to give a varying list based on types, stats, and accessability. I believe that I will be able to do this before the deadline

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

This section I am thinking of aesthetic changes. Making the list look good and engaging once it is generated and the overall look of the application.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

My next steps will be placing the csv file into an SQL database for easier access. Also working on the code required tosplit the sdatabase up into all of the components I will need. Also I will need to brush up on the specific python needed to do so, as I am familiar with how to do it in java, and I remember that we learned it earlier in the semester so I just need to refresh. I feel like I have all of the skills needed, I may just need a refresher. I am doing the whole thing on my own so my strategy for approaching this is going to be to take it one step at a time. Do one step of the assignmetn, then the next, etc. I need to make sure that they final product does not become too grand a task and that I can take it in several parts in order to not get overwhelmed.
