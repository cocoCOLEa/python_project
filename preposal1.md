# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

I was thinking that I would use the Pokemon csv file from class to create a VGC helper application. Where you could type in the name of the pokemon you are trying to counter and the python would find you a good pokemon to use against them. Checking the stats and pokemon types in order to do so.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

I will be working on my own

## Do you have any questions of your own?

I do not have any questions at the moment
